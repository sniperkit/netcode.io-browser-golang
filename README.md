# netcode.io-browser-golang
netcode.io-browser ported to golang

NOTE: this is likely to be a temporary repository, until these changes are merged into https://github.com/RedpointGames/netcode.io-browser

I *HIGHLY* recommend not relying on this code directly and wait for it's absorption.

```
|- netcode.io.demoserver/
`- netcode.io.host/
```

* `netcode.io.host` is an installable go application. works in windows/mac/linux
* `netcode.io.demoserver` is the backend that provides a web server to test in a browser, as well as a netcode server instance
